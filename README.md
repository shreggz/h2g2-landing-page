# h2g2-landing-page
I made this project for the Foundations course of "The Odin Project." The idea was to make a modern landing page from scratch using the HTML and CSS skills I've learned so far. This was a particularly good exercise for practicing how to position items on a page using flexbox.

I decided to imagine what a website made to sell copies of "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" would look like, and went from there.

A note on sources:

Most of the text on this page is pulled directly from "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" by Douglas Adams.

The babel fish is from the 1981 BBC adaptation of H2G2.
