# h2g2-landing-page
I made this project for the Foundations course of "The Odin Project." The idea was to make a modern landing page from scratch using the HTML and CSS skills I've learned so far. This was a particularly good exercise for practicing how to position items on a page using flexbox.

I decided to imagine what a website made to sell copies of "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" would look like, and went from there.
