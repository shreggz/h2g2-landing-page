            <h2>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a wholly remarkable book.</h2>
            <p>Not only is it a wholly remarkable book, it is also a highly successful one--more popular than the <i>Celestial Home Care Omnibus</i>, better selling than <i>Fifty More Things to do in Zero Gravity</i>, and more controversial than Oolon Colluphid's trilogy of philosophical blockbusters <i>Where God Went Wrong</i>, <i>Some More of God's Greatest Mistakes</i>, and <i>Who is this God Person Anyway?</i></p>
