        <h1>Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster</h1>
        <p>This is the best drink in existence! It's a potent cocktail invented by Zaphod Beeblebrox. The effects have been likened to having your brains smashed out with a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick.</p>
        <p>There are many voluntary organizations which will help to rehabilitate you after you've had one.</p>
        <p>Here are the instructions for mixing a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster yourself:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Take the juice from one bottle of that Ol' Janx Spirit.</li>
            <li>Pour into it one measure of water from the seas of Santraginus V.</li>
            <li>Allow three cubes of Arcturan Mega-gin to melt into the mixture (it must be properly iced or the benzine is lost).</li>
            <li>Allow four litres of Fallian marsh gas to bubble through it, in memory of all those happy Hikers who have died of pleasure in the Marshes of Fallia.</li>
            <li>Over the back of a silver spoon float a measure of Qualactin Hypermint extract, redolent of all the heady odours of the dark Qualactin Zones, subtle sweet and mystic.</li>
            <li>Drop in the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger. Watch it dissolve, spreading the fires of the Algolian Suns deep into the heart of the drink.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle Zamphuor.</li>
            <li>Add an olive.</li>
            <li>Drink...but...very carefully...</li>
        </ol>
